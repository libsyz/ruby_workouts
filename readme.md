## Ruby Workouts 🏃🏋

### About

This is a collection of short ruby exercises around:

- Enumerables
- Arrays
- Hashes

The purpose of the exercises are to:

- Help you internalise the Ruby syntax.
- Help you become more familiar with the Ruby core library.
- Become faster at doing frequent manipulations with core data structures.

Therefore, most exercises can be solved with 1-2 lines of code. These are not
katas to stretch your algorithmic thinking, but exercises to help you internalize Ruby fundamentals. The test cases are there to provide
guardrails, but they are not exhaustive.

### About

- `git clone` the repository
- go to the folder with the exercises you wish to practice
- run `bundle install`in your terminal
- type `rspec` in the terminal and start working through the tests
