## Ruby Workouts 🏃🏋

### About

This is a collection of short ruby exercises around:

- Enumerables
- Arrays
- Hashes

The purpose of the exercises are to:

- Help you internalise the Ruby syntax.
- Help you become more familiar with the Ruby core library.
- Become faster at doing frequent manipulations with core data structures.

Therefore, most exercises can be solved with 1-2 lines of code. These are not
katas to help you refine your thinking. The test cases are there to provide
guardrails, but they are not exhaustive.

### About

- `git clone` the repository
- go to the folder with the exercises you wish to practice
- run `bundle install`in your terminal
- type `rspec` in the terminal and start working through the tests
